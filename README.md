# TechBlog


## https://tech-blog-for-tech.herokuapp.com/


### The Concept
The goal of this assignment was to create a blog with a few functions that the user can interact with: a login/logout function, a signup function, and most importantly, a function that lets the user create posts for others to view.  The idea is simple and straightforward.

### The Build
This is was an exceptionally difficult project for someone with my level of experience; much of what I wrote was written with the help of classmates, and even then, there are parts of it that I do not fully understand.

### The Result
I still cannot get this app to run, on either my local machine or Heroku.  I am still combing through the files to see what is going wrong, because I cannot login or logout properly, and the link to the dashboard doesn't take me anywhere.
